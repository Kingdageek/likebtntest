# Simple Like Button Implementation

Clone the repo or download it. Create a `likebtntest` db and run the SQL code in the *database* directory on it to get the `likes` and `posts` tables. 

A *userId* is manually assigned to a `SESSION` variable. Ideally, a unique user identifier like *userId* or *username* should be obtained from the database.
